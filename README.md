# Tate Ray
I am a Freelance Software Engineer seeking a full-time position in the tech sector. After over five years in the food service industry, I decided to pivot to software engineering. My previous career gives me the insights and skills to work on diverse, highly collaborative, and multi-disciple teams. As a motivated self-starter, I have pursued a non-traditional route into the industry, seeking out projects and challenges that have pushed me to expand and refine my skills. My work as a freelancer has exposed me to projects ranging from modernizing legacy web pages to architecting business solutions for a rapidly growing small business.  Additionally, I have pursued personal projects that have refined my skill set, allowing me to be versatile in tackling many tasks.
